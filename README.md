# NandToTetris - Project 6 - Assembler in NodeJS

Project has been built during course [NandToTetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)!
The assembler allows us to translate Assembly Language into Machine Language.

# Usage

For sure feel free to get this code and use it for yourself. I'd like to explain you how to use the assembler.

1.  After clone this repository on your machine, create some code in Hack Language and for better explain move the file into input directory.
2.  Open your terminal and use that command:

    $ node assembler input/fileName.asm

3.  Open directory output and there you should get a fileName.hack - this file is ready to use by CPUEmulator.sh
